# Univariate-and-Bivariate-Statistical-Analysis-using-Python
This project focuses on the practical implementation of descriptive statistical analysis using Python. The assignment explores both univariate and bivariate data analysis techniques to understand data distribution, central tendency, variability, and relationships between variables.

The notebook demonstrates the use of statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and correlation, along with data visualization techniques including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts. Popular Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used to perform analysis and generate insights.

This project helps build a strong foundation in statistics and data analysis, making it useful for beginners in data science, analytics, and machine learning.
